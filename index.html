                        <strong>What is Self Love?</strong>
                        When we talk about ‘self loveʼ, what goes on in the minds of most people is all about the saying ‘love yourself before you love anotherʼ. <br>
                        You canʼt give what you donʼt have right?. Itʼs very accurate but itʼs a lot deeper than that. <br>
                        We all put smiles on our faces everyday, I mean itʼs very easy to pretend to be happy. <br>
                        But what we all forget sometimes is that, we get accustomed to and addicted to things we love to do often. <br>
                        Some of us go the extent of pretending to be happy that we actually forget what true happiness feels like, <br>
                        sometimes we are unhappy without even knowing and we get used to unhappiness that it slowly becomes an addiction or a hobby, <br>
                        it becomes who we are. I was unhappy for so many years donʼt get this the wrong way, some people might think itʼs because I <br>
                        didnʼt have friends, but rather I had amazing friends so many I was practically a happy child so I thought, <br>
                        you will hardly see me without smiles until one day I had to examine myself with sincerity, <br>
                        you can lie to others but you can never lie to yourself. I thought about so many things; <br>
                        the friends you meet (both the good and bad ones),the things we do just to fit in or just to be regarded or called a friend,<br> we tolerate peopleʼs crap,not because weʼre nice or weʼre weak 
                        but itʼs simply because of the lack of self love, <br> because we donʼt love ourselves enough so we donʼt place value on ourselves. <br>
                        Itʼs very easy to post, but do you truly love yourself? Weʼre not talking about posting pictures on Instagram, I mean do you <br>
                        truly love yourself to the extent that you wonʼt tolerate peopleʼs crap?

                    </div>

                    <p class="para">
                        Do you truly love yourself to that extent where you feel you donʼt need to be loved by anybody but yourself? <br>
                        Do you truly love yourself to the extent that you could stay months or years without any from of relationship except with your creator? <br>
                        Don't get me wrong, we all need people at every stage of our journey on this planet, but when we don't meet such people, can we stay and be <br>
                        comfortable in our skin and use that period to work on our relationship with God?  <br>
                        Do you truly love yourself to the extent of putting yourself before anyone or anything? <br>
                        Do you truly love yourself to the extent where you never feel pressured to do something against your will? <br>
                        Do you truly love yourself to the extent where you teach people how to treat you by deciding what you will and wonʼt accept?. <br>
                        I heard someone saying “when you know who you are you donʼt act like everyone else”. <br>
                        Examine yourself, self love is one of the greatest feeling on earth. <br>
                        If you truly know what it means I know I do and am loving every moment of my life. <br>
                        You deserve to feel that way too, I strongly encourage everybody to embark on the journey of self love. <br>
                        Enough is enough you deserve the best. Never settle for less Never!! <br><br><br><br>
